# CRAWLING ROBOT - Reinforcement learning

In this project, I implemented a simulator for teaching a robot dog how to move.
The robot has four legs, each one with two actuated joints. The legs move in couple: the front-left leg moves together with the back-right; the remaining two legs are coupled as well.
The robot learns to move using a Q-learning algorithm.
